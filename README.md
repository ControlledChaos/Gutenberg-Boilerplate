Build your first Gutenberg Editor block! A boilerplate to build WP Gutenberg blocks and stuff! ✊

## Getting Started


1. Install & activate the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) WordPress plugin
2. Then download and install/activate this [Gutenberg Boilerplate plugin](https://github.com/ahmadawais/Gutenberg-Boilerplate/archive/master.zip) ← Just click this link to download.
3. All blocks added by this boilerplate are prefixed with `GB` as in Gutenberg-Boilerplate. Take a look at the GIFs below to see how to try 'em out.
4. To try the ESNext block, i.e. `02-basic-esnext` go to it's directory i.e.  `gutenberg-boilerpalte/block/02-basic-esnext` and run `npm install`. Make sure you have [Node and npm installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then in the `02-basic-esnext` directory run `npm run dev` for development or `npm run build` to build the production code.
4. Now read the source code to learn how to build blocks. It's heavily documented.
